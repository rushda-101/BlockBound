# BlockBound - Game Design Document

## 1. Project Overview/Game Concept
- Title: BlockBound
- Genre: 2D Platformer
- Platform: PC
- Engine: Godot
- Programming Language: GDScript
- Target Audience: Casual and intermediate players who enjoy skill-based progression games.

BlockBound is a three-level 2D platformer inspired by classic games such as Super Mario Bros. The player navigates through a digital world, collecting coins while avoiding hazards in order to reach the level exit. Each level increases in difficulty through tighter platform spacing, greater hazards and more complex traversal challenges.

The design prioritises mechanical clarity, progressive challenge and reward-driven engagement.

## 2. User and System Requirements (Scrum Style)

### 2.1 User Requirements
User requirements are defined using Scrum-style user stories to reflect player needs.

Core Gameplay Requirements:
* US1 – Movement: 
  As a player, I want to move left and right using WASD so that I can navigate the environment.
* US2 – Jumping: 
  As a player, I want to jump onto platforms so that I can traverse vertical spaces.
* US3 – Coin Collection: 
  As a player, I want to collect coins so that I am rewarded for exploration and skillful movement.
* US4 – Hazard Interaction: 
  As a player, I want hazards to reduce my lives on contact so that the game feels challenging.
* US5 – Lives System: 
  As a player, I want a limited number of lives so that success requires skill and precision.
* US6 – Level Progression: 
  As a player, I want to progress through increasingly difficult levels so that the game remains engaging.
* US7 – Level Completion: 
  As a player, I want a clear goal point so that I understand how to complete each level.

### 2.2 System Requirements
The system must:
* Detect and process WASD input.
* Apply gravity and physics using Godot’s built-in physics engine.
* Remove coins upon collection.
* Update and display score dynamically.
* Track and decrement lives.
* Reset player position upon life loss.
* Transition between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
* Trigger Game Over state when lives reach zero.

  Detect collision between:
  * Player and platforms
  * Player and coins
  * Player and hazards

### 2.3 Prioritisation (MoSCoW Method)
Must have:
* Player movement and jump
* Collision detection
* Gravity physics
* Coin collection system
* Hazard system
* Lives system
* Three complete levels
* Level transition system

Should have:
* Score UI
* Level indicator
* Game Over screen

Could have:
* Sound effects
* Animated coins
* Background music

This prioritisation ensures the core gameplay loop is completed before polish features.

Each backlog item is considered complete only when it satisfies functional testing and playtesting evaluation.

## 4. Research, Planning & Design

### 4.1 Overall Design Strategy
BlockBound adopts a progressive difficulty scaling model, a common structure within 2D platformers. Research into classic platform game design, particularly early side-scrolling platformers such as Super Mario Bros, demonstrates that difficulty is most effectively introduced gradually through spatial design rather than sudden mechanical complexity.
Game design literature on player engagement suggests that maintaining player motivation requires balancing challenge and ability (often described in Flow Theory). Based on this principle, BlockBound maintains consistent core mechanics (movement and jump) while increasing environmental complexity across levels.

Difficulty progression is therefore implemented through:
* Reduced platform size
* Increased hazard frequency
* Risk-reward coin placement
* Tighter jump timing

This ensures mechanical consistency while increasing player mastery requirements.

### 4.2 Game Story
Research into modern indie platformers indicates that excessive narrative can distract from gameplay-focused experiences. Therefore, BlockBound adopts a minimalist environmental narrative approach, inspired by digital-themed indie titles and arcade-era platformers.

The player is trapped within a fragmented digital simulation composed of block structures. Each level represents increasing difficulty and increased thought processing within the gameplay. By collecting coins and reaching the exit portal, the player stabilises each sector and progresses toward escape.

The narrative is minimalistic to keep focus on gameplay mechanics.

### 4.3 Level Design
Level design in platform games traditionally follows a structured teaching model:
1. Introduce mechanic safely
2. Reinforce mechanic with variation
3. Combine mechanics under pressure

This structure is widely observed in early platformers and continues in modern design practice.

#### Level 1 – Introduction
* Wide platforms
* Minimal hazards
* Safe coin placement
* Low punishment

Purpose:
* Teach core mechanics
* Allow player experimentation
* Establish control familiarity

This aligns with research on onboarding design, where early success builds player confidence.

#### Level 2 – Escalation
* Reduced platform width
* Increased verticality
* Hazards positioned between jumps
* Moderate risk coin placement

Purpose:
* Increase precision requirement
* Encourage careful movement
* Reinforce learned mechanics under pressure

This stage reflects the “skill consolidation” phase in progressive level design.

#### Level 3 – Mastery
* Small landing zones
* Clustered hazards
* Limited safe recovery space
* High-risk coin placement

Purpose:
* Demand mastery of timing and positioning
* Increase cognitive load
* Reward experienced players

Research into difficulty curves suggests that final levels should test mechanical fluency rather than introduce new mechanics, ensuring fairness and avoiding frustration.

### 4.4 Gameplay Loop
The gameplay loop is structured around a classic reward-feedback cycle:
Navigate → Avoid hazards → Collect coins → Reach exit → Progress

Research into player motivation models highlights four key components:
* Player State – Active exploration
* Need – Survival & progression
* Challenge – Platform precision & hazard avoidance
* Reward – Score increase & level completion

Coins function as extrinsic rewards, reinforcing exploration behaviour. The lives system introduces tension, increasing perceived stakes without overwhelming difficulty.

This structure aligns with established reward-challenge loops used in arcade-style games.

### 4.5 Game Rules
Clear and consistent rules are fundamental to perceived fairness in games. Research into player retention indicates that predictable rule systems reduce frustration.

BlockBound follows consistent rule logic:
* Player begins with 3 lives.
* Hazard contact reduces 1 life.
* Player respawns at level start.
* Falling below map boundary results in life loss.
* Game ends at 0 lives.
* Level completion triggered by reaching exit object.

No hidden mechanics are introduced across levels. All hazards behave consistently to preserve fairness.

### 4.6 System Architecture
BlockBound is developed using Godot due to research into engine suitability for 2D platform development.

Godot provides:
* Built-in physics engine
* Native collision detection
* Scene-based architecture
* TileMap support for efficient level design
* Lightweight project structure

Research comparing custom-coded physics engines versus built-in physics systems suggests that using established engines reduces implementation risk and increases stability, particularly within limited development timeframes.

#### Architectural Design
Scenes:
* Main Menu
* Level 1
* Level 2
* Level 3
* Game Over

Scripts:
* Player.gd
* Coin.gd
* Hazard.gd
* GameManager.gd

Node Types:
* CharacterBody2D (Player)
* Area2D (Coins & Hazards)
* TileMap (Level Layout)
* CanvasLayer (UI)

This modular architecture follows separation-of-concerns principles, improving maintainability and scalability.

### 4.7 State Diagram
The game follows a finite state model:
<img width="361" height="551" alt="BlockBound State Diagram drawio" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a103eb-e46c-4efd-8b83-909786528a2b" />

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are widely used in game architecture research due to their clarity and predictability. Implementing structured state transitions reduces logic errors and improves debugging efficiency.

### 4.8 Technical Challenges
Based on research into common 2D platform development issues, anticipated challenges include:
* Preventing unintended double-jumping
* Fine-tuning gravity for natural movement feel
* Ensuring collision boundaries are accurate
* Managing scene transitions without variable loss
* Balancing difficulty progression

Mitigation strategies:
* Use Godot’s built-in physics methods (move_and_slide)
* Implement grounded checks for jump control
* Conduct iterative playtesting
* Use version control for rollback safety

This proactive risk identification demonstrates structured development planning.
